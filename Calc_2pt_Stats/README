21/10/2020, most scripts written by C. Heymans et al. 2D GGL measurement codes by B. Giblin.

Codes:

1. calc_xi_w_treecorr.py
input two KiDS fits shear catalogue names and this script calculates xi+/- correlation between them with treecorr.

2. calc_gt_w_treecorr.py
same as above, but inputs are source shear catalogue and lens&random position catalogue fits file names, and output
is gamma_t.

3. create_tomocats.py
reads in a shear catalogue fits file name and saves an output shear catalogue with the designated redshift cut applied.

4. doall_calc2pt.sh
master script to execute the above scripts for the KiDS catalogues.

5. cuillinrun_calc2pt.sh
script to sbatch launch doall_calc2pt.sh job to cuillin workers

6. cuillinrun_calc2pt_mocks.sh
same as above but for running on Chieh-An Lin's mock catalogues of KiDS-1000 instead of the data itself.

7. Run_2D_GGL_K1000.py
Reads in KiDS-1000 shear catalogue and BOSS lens catalogue, applies designated redshift cuts to each and calculates
the 2D gamma_t signal in lots of patches out to 20 arcmin, stacks the patches.
Also can measure the 1D angular gamma_t with this same code.
This produces the measurements that go into Fig. 10 in Giblin et al. (2020). Using the 2D GGL signal to detect
additive shear systematics that vanish in the 1D angular GGL signal.

8. Plot_2D_GGL_Results.py
Plot the results from Run_GGL_K1000.py, producing Fig. 10 in Giblin et al. (2020).

9. Functions_2DGGL.py
Contains simple function that return elements in an array falling with a prescribed (ra1-ra2, dec1-dec2) patch.
Used by Run_2D_GGL_K1000.py.
