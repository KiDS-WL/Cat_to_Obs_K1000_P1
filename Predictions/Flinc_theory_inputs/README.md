# SALMO mock inputs

In [Joachimi, Lin, Asgari, Tr√∂ster, Heymans et al. 2020][2] we build a series of mock KiDS surveys using [SALMO][1] (Speedy Acquisition for Lensing and Matter Observables).   SALMO was previously called Flinc - Fast-Linc in honour of Chieh-An Lin (Linc) who created it!   This directory contains all the theoretical models that are used as inputs to the mocks.   These were created with the KiDS Cosmology Analysis Pipeline [KCAP][3] which is built from [CosmoSIS][4].
