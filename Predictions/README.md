## Theoretical Models

This directory contains theoretical models for a given Cosmology, created using the KiDS Cosmology Analysis Pipeline [KCAP][3] which is built from [CosmoSIS][4].

### iterated_cov_MAP_BlindC
Theoretical predictions for the full 3x2pt data vector, derived at the best-fit Cosmology published in [Heymans, Tr√∂ster et al. 2020][1].

### kcap_xi
Cosmic shear predictions for a range of different S_8 values, used to determine the impact of low-level PSF systematics, as described in [Giblin, Heymans, Asgari et al. 2020][2]. 

## Flinc_theory_inputs
Theoretical predictions for the mock KiDS surveys built using [SALMO][5] (Speedy Acquisition for Lensing and Matter Observables).
