21/10/2020, Codes written primarily by B. Giblin, hacked by C. Heymans.

1. Plot_1pt_Tests.py
This code reads in the shear catalogue and the PSF data catalogue for KiDS-1000 and produces plots including:
 - avg PSF ellipticity and residual PSF ellipticity VS (X,Y) position on CCD (Fig. 2, Giblin et al. 2020).
 - avg galaxy ellipticity VS (X,Y). 
 - avg y VS avg x : e.g., alpha (PSF leakage) VS tomo redshift bin (Fig. 6 of Giblin+20). 
 - avg magnitude VS ZB
 etc.

2. Plot_Star_Col-Col.py
This code reads in the KiDS-1000 source catalogue & PSF catalogue and plots the colour-colour distribution of these objects
(Fig. 1 of Giblin+20). By cross-matching the objects in the source and PSF catalogues, we quantify the galaxy contamination
to the PSF sample. 
Overplots the Baldri et al. (2010) stellar locus.

3. fitting.py
Simple code to fit either a linear function, or a general user-defined funtion, to some input data.

4. Make_K1000_MassMaps.py
Read in shear data for KiDS-1000 and perform spherical harmonic transform to get kappa maps.
Also do a series of noise realisations to make signal/noise maps.
The products of this code are not intended for scientific analysis, mainly just for pretty maps / press release.

4. K1000_MassMaps_SimplePlotCode_4KiDS.py
Read in and plot different projections of the KiDS-1000 SNR maps (kappa maps / noise maps).
This code was made to optimise the prettiness of the maps.
