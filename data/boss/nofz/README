These files contain the effective weighted n(z) for 2dFLenS and BOSS.
The code that created them is
https://github.com/KiDS-WL/Cat_to_Obs_K1000_P1/blob/ggl_lenscats/GGL_LensCats/BOSS_2dFLenS_n_of_z_calc_and_plot.py

Any questions:  Catherine

The two lens bins are:
z1: 0.2<z<0.5
z2: 0.5<z<0.75

In 2dFLenS_weighted_n_of_z*.txt  the gri weights are included such that the n(z) matches BOSS more closely

In BOSS_and_2dFLenS_n_of_z*.txt we do not use any weights for 2dFLenS, but include the BOSS completeness weights

Everything apart from BOSS_NGP_n_of_z*.txt limits the sample to be contained within the KiDS-gri footprint.   The NGP file contains all BOSS galaxies in the NGP.
