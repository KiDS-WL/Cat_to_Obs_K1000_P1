# Testing the impact of a PSF residual on the cosmological parameter inference

This directory contains the Blind A data corrected for the psf residual model identified in Section 3.5 of [Giblin, Heymans, Asgari et al. 2020][1].   This was used to determine that the shift in the recovered S8 value when the psf model was applied was less that 0.1 sigma.
