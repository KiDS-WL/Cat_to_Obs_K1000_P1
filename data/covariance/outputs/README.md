# Ascii Covariance Matrices for the COSEBIs cosmic shear data vector

This directory contains the covariance matrices for the COSEBIs cosmic shear data vector.  The tag "bestfit_3x2pt" means that the cosmological parameters used in this covariance come from the best fitting cosmology from the first iteration of Heymans, Troester et al. (2020).  While the other ones without this tag use the cosmology from Troster et al. (2020).
