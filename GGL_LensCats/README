The code uses: numpy, scipy, astropy, matplotlib.

==================================
**Download data**

The original datasets you need:

- The BOSS DR12 LRG data and random catalogue in the NGP:

https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr12/boss/lss/
wget https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr12/boss/lss/galaxy_DR12v5_CMASSLOWZTOT_North.fits.gz
wget https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr12/boss/lss/random0_DR12v5_CMASSLOWZTOT_North.fits.gz

- The 2dFLenS LRG data and random catalogue in both KIDS-S and KiDS-N, I have prepared new versions on the 
2dFLenS website in the revised DR12 redshift slices:

click on "data release" -- the 6 catalogues under "data generated in final BOSS redshift binning"

- The KiDS-S and N photometry catalogues you produced, they are currently called 
kids1000_N_col.fits and kids1000_S_col.fits
- Note these need to be superuser KiDS catalogues, not the lensing catalogues
- The lensing catalogues have a weight>0 cut which removes most of the BOSS/2dFLenS galaxies

=================================

The code performs the following steps:

(1) Specify redshift bin to generate (ired = 1/2/3 on the command line).

(2) Read in BOSS data/randoms in KiDS-N, cutting to (R.A., Dec.) boundaries specified in the code 
    (a bit larger than the KiDS-N boundaries, which you can tweak if you wish).  
    Sub-sample BOSS randoms to be 40x data size, as for 2dFLenS.

(3) Read in 2dFLenS data/randoms in both KiDS-S and KiDS-N -- (we could potentially exclude the 
    2dFLenS data in KiDS-N, it doesn't overlap with BOSS but I also don't think it overlaps with KiDS at 
    the moment -- but will do in future).

(4) Read in KiDS photometric catalogues in KiDS-S and KiDS-N.

(5) Match BOSS/2dFLenS data to KiDS photometric catalogues, nearest neighbour within 1 arcsec.  
    Note that ~10% of overlap galaxies (and all non-overlap galaxies of course) do not currently match.  
    There is a flag "iphot" which tracks whether or not there is a match.  
    The photometric quantities extracted for the magnitude/colour weighting are: g-r, r-i and r. 

(6) Determine weights to match magnitude/colour distribution of 2dFLenS to BOSS, 
    using Hendrik's KV450 DIR method.  Unmatched objects are given weight=1.

(7) Determine weights to match magnitude/colour distribution of BOSS to 2dFLenS.  
    Unmatched objects are given weight=1.

The code then outputs fits files for all the data and random lenses (not just matched lenses) with columns:

RA,DEC,Z -- R.A., Dec., redshift
WEICOMP -- BOSS completeness weight (=1 for 2dFLenS)
WEIFKP -- FKP weights (these are used for BOSS clustering, so you probably need them)
FLAGPHOT -- 0 or 1 if there is a match to the photometric catalogues
WEIMAG -- weight to match the magnitude/colour distribution of the other survey
GRCOL, RICOL, RMAG -- saving these in order to easily produce plots of the distributions 
                      (could potentially delete these columns)

Random lenses have WEICOMP=1, FLAGPHOT=0, WEIMAG=1 
                      (not entirely sure what weight to give random lenses if the data lenses have 
                      magnitude/colour weights).

The standard weight to use to correspond to the BOSS clustering analysis would be WEICOMP*WEIFKP.

The other branch of the code ("testcats") produces various check plots and outputs which
produces a useful weighted vs unweighted plot of the colours and magnitudes amongst other things
